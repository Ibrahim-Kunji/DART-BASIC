# Dart Basic Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Dart programs Iâ€™ve created for learning and practice, along with a more advanced project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. These programs cover various fundamental concepts of the Dart programming language and serve as a foundation for further development.

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my progress as I learn and experiment with Dart. It acts as a personal reference and a way to track my growth as I develop proficiency in Dart programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Basic Dart Programs
Each file in this folder is an individual Dart program focused on fundamental concepts, including:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow statements (if/else, loops)
- Functions and closures
- Classes and object-oriented principles
- Collections (lists, sets, maps)
- Error handling, and more

These programs provide foundational understanding and can be used as a quick reference for Dart essentials.

### 2. Project: Student Management System
Along with the basic programs, I've developed an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project called **Student Management System**. This project is interactive, utilizing user input to perform various functions, and serves as a practical application of multiple Dart concepts in an integrated project.

#### Project Overview
The *Student Management System* allows users to:
1. Add a new student
2. Display all students
3. Update student details
4. Delete a student
5. Exit the application

This project demonstrates my understanding of OOP principles, data handling, and user interaction in Dart.

#### Sample Output
Hereâ€™s an example of the menu options available in the *Student Management System*:
