# Dart Basic Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Dart programs that I have created for learning and practice. The programs cover various fundamental concepts of the Dart programming language.

## Purpose

The main goal of this folder is to store my Dart programs as I continue to learn and experiment with the language. It serves as a personal reference and a way to track my progress.

## Structure

Each file in this folder is a separate Dart program, demonstrating different concepts and functionalities. Feel free to explore the files!

## Note

This repository is primarily for my own practice. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
